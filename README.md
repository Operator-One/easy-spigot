# easy-spigot

Early stages of development and testing. 

While in current form it is for standalone bare-metal RockyLinux 9 machines, it will evolve into a self deploying docker container. 

Easy-Spigot setups everything up needed to host a cross-play/bedrock compatible minecraft server. 

If hosting publically, you'll need to forward some ports
  For Java MC - Port 25565/tcp
  For Bedrock MC - Port 19132/udp
  For Crossplay MC - Port 19133/udp
  For Crossplay DNS - Port 53
